### Feature: Telegram bot token stored in dedicated global file

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- A valid Telegram bot token is available.
- Access to `~/.codex/` on the host machine.

#### Steps
1. In the app UI, open Telegram connection and submit a bot token.
2. Verify file `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` exists.
3. Open `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` and confirm it contains a `botToken` field.
4. Restart the app server and call Telegram status endpoint from UI to confirm it still reports configured.

#### Expected Results
- Telegram token is persisted in `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.
- Telegram bridge remains configured after restart.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` to clear saved Telegram token.

### Feature: Telegram chatIds persisted for bot DM sending

#### Prerequisites
- App server is running from this repository.
- Telegram bot already configured in the app.
- Access to `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.

#### Steps
1. Send `/start` to the Telegram bot from your DM.
2. Wait for the app to process the update, then open `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.
3. Confirm `chatIds` contains your DM chat id as the first element.
4. In the app, reconnect Telegram bot with the same token.
5. Re-open `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` and confirm `chatIds` remains present.

#### Expected Results
- `chatIds` is written after Telegram DM activity.
- `chatIds` persists across bot reconfiguration.
- `botToken` and `chatIds` are both present in `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json`.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove `chatIds` or delete `~/.codex/telegram-bridge.json` to clear persisted chat targets.

### Feature: Skills dropdown closes after selection in composer

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one thread exists and can be selected.
- At least one installed skill is available.

#### Steps
1. Open an existing thread so the message composer is enabled.
2. Click the `Skills` dropdown in the composer footer.
3. Click any skill option in the dropdown list.
4. Re-open the `Skills` dropdown and click the same skill again to unselect it.

#### Expected Results
- The skills dropdown closes immediately after each selection click.
- Selected skill appears as a chip above the composer input when checked.
- Skill chip is removed when the skill is unchecked on the next selection.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Remove the selected skill chip(s) before leaving the thread, if needed.

### Feature: Skills Hub manual search trigger

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Open the `Skills Hub` view.

#### Steps
1. Type a unique query value in the Skills Hub search input (for example: `docker`), but do not press Enter or click Search yet.
2. Confirm the browse results do not refresh immediately while typing.
3. Click the `Search` button.
4. Change the query text to another value and press Enter in the input.
5. Clear the query, then click `Search` to reload the default browse list.

#### Expected Results
- Typing alone does not trigger remote Skills Hub search requests.
- Results refresh only after explicit submit via the `Search` button or Enter key.
- Empty-state text (if shown) references the last submitted query.
- Submitting an empty query returns the default skills listing.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Clear the search input and run a blank search to return to default listing.

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Appearance is set to `Dark` in Settings.
- Skills Hub route is accessible.

#### Steps
1. Open the home/new-thread screen and inspect the `Local project / New worktree` runtime selector trigger.
2. Open the runtime selector and verify menu title, options, selected state, and checkmark visibility in dark mode.
3. Trigger a worktree action that shows worktree status and verify running/error status blocks remain readable in dark mode.
4. Open `Skills Hub` and verify header/subtitle, search bar, search/sort buttons, sync panel, badges, and status text.
5. Verify at least one skill card surface (title, owner, description, date, browse icon) in dark mode.
6. Open a skill detail modal and verify panel, title/owner, close button, README/body text, and footer actions in dark mode.

#### Expected Results

### Feature: Markdown file links with backticks and parentheses render correctly

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- An active thread is open.
- Local file exists at `/root/New Project (1)/qwe.txt`.

#### Steps
1. Send a message containing: `Done. Created [`/root/New Project (1)/qwe.txt`](/root/New Project (1)/qwe.txt) with content:`.
2. In the rendered assistant message, click the `/root/New Project (1)/qwe.txt` link.
3. Right-click the same link and choose `Copy link` from the context menu.
4. Paste the copied link into a text field and inspect it.

#### Expected Results
- The markdown link renders as one clickable file link (not split into partial tokens).
- Clicking opens the local browse route for the full file path.
- Copied link includes the full encoded path and still resolves to the same file.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Delete `/root/New Project (1)/qwe.txt` if it was created only for this test.

### Feature: Runtime selector uses a toggle-style control

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Home/new-thread screen is open.
